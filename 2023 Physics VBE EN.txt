During the second test, a real and twice magnified image of the candle was obtained with the converging lens. The distance between the screen and the lens is 15 cm. Calculate the distance from the lens to the candle.
A 17.1 cm
*B 7.5 cm
C 4.5 cm
D 3.1 cm

Γ=f/d => d=f/Γ => d=15/2=7.5



III-6 3. Name which visual impairment - nearsightedness or farsightedness - can be corrected with contact lenses.
A Nothing
B Myopia and hyperopia
C Myopia
*D Farsightedness





III-6 4.  In front of the retina or behind the retina, which part of the eye does the image form in contact lens-corrected visual impairment?
A Before the retina
*B Behind the retina
C In the retina
D Does not change





III-6 5. Name the wave optics phenomenon that causes a converging lens to collect violet light on the main optical axis closer to the lens than red light.
A Diffraction
B Interference
*C Dispersion
D Reflection

Dispersion of light is called the dependence of the quantity (refractive index) characterizing the light on the color (frequency) of the light.



III-7 While studying nuclear transformations, the scientists found that 18.35 MeV of energy is released during the presented fusion reaction of helium and hydrogen isotopes. $^{3}_{2}\mathrm{He} + ^{2}_{1}\mathrm{D} \rightarrow ^{4}_{2}\mathrm{He} + ^{1}_{ 1}\mathrm{H}$ 1. Name the elementary particles in which the nuclei of the isotopes of the element differ in number.
A Protons
*B Neutrons
C Protons and electrons
D Electrons





III-7 While studying nuclear transformations, the scientists found that 18.35 MeV of energy is released during the presented fusion reaction of helium and hydrogen isotopes. 2. Estimate the mass defect for this fusion reaction in atomic mass units.
A 0.20 a.m.v.
B 0.45 a.m.v.
*C 0.02 a.m.v.
D 0.76 a.m.v.

m=E/931.5=18.35/931.5=0.0196994...  Because. Mass-energy coupling factor 931.5 MeV/a.m.v.



III-7 3. Give one argument why there would be less environmental problems if we got our energy from fusion reactors.
*A No carbon dioxide is released
B Carbon dioxide is released
C Water is released
D Oxygen is evolved





III-7  $^{3}_{2}\mathrm{He} + ^{2}_{1}\mathrm{D} \rightarrow ^{4}_{2}\mathrm{He} + ^{1}_{1}\mathrm{H}$ 4. On which side of the given fusion reaction equation, the left or the right side, is the sum of the masses of the nuclei larger? Justify your answer.
*A On the left
B On the right
C Left and right
D Sometimes left, sometimes right





III-7  While studying nuclear transformations, the scientists found that 18.35 MeV of energy is released during the presented fusion reaction of helium and hydrogen isotopes. 5. When fuel burns, carbon combines with oxygen, and during one such chemical reaction, approximately 5.5 eV of energy is released. Calculate approximately how many times this energy is less than the energy released in one of the fusion reactions of the mentioned isotopes
A $4 \cdot 10^{-7}$
B $7 \cdot 10^{-7}$
C $6 \cdot 10^{-7}$
*D $3 \cdot 10^{-7}$

$5.5/(18.35 \cdot 1000000)=2.997 \cdot 10^{-7} $



III-7 What field do scientists use in fusion reactors to solve the problem of how to maintain high-temperature plasma in a vacuum?
A Electric
*B Magnetic
C Gravitational
D He doesn't use anything, he keeps himself
